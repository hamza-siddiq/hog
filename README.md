# Hog

• Developed a dice game, where two players took turns in order to reach the maximum score of 100. Some rules that were added included:

Sow Sad: If the dice outcome was 1, the players score for the turn was 1.

Picky Piggy: A player that chose to roll zero fices scored the nth digit of the decimal expansion of 1/7 (0.14285714...) where n was the opponent’s score. If n was 0, the opponent got 7 points.

Hog Pile: If the players scores were the same after scores were added, the current players score double.
